# About #

**MESH IN SPACE** (registered business name) was founded as a spin-off of the [University of South Australia (UniSA)](https://unisa.edu.au) on 5 December 2021.

On 9 February 2022, we were officially [announced](https://icc.unisa.edu.au/newsroom/2022/international-and-interstate-space-companies-flock-to-south-australia-for-venture-catalyst-program) to be part of the 2022 [Venture Catalyst Space](https://icc.unisa.edu.au/programs/venture-catalyst-space) program organised by UniSA’s [Innovation & Collaboration Centre (ICC)](https://icc.unisa.edu.au).

# What we do #

__Problem:__ Satellite constellations are expanding rapidly at low Earth orbits (LEOs), and their connectivity is best served by the mesh topology. However, there is a lack of homegrown secure communication solutions.

__Solution:__ The [Australian Civil Space Strategy 2019-2028](https://www.industry.gov.au/data-and-publications/australian-civil-space-strategy-2019-2028) has four Strategic Space Pillars, one of which is to _develop national capability in areas of competitive advantage_. Guided by this Strategic Space Pillar, we are currently dedicating ourselves to building a mission-ready communication software suite, including a network protocol stack, for mesh-networked satellite constellations focusing on cybersecurity.
* The suite uses frameworks and protocols recommended by the [Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS)](https://public.ccsds.org) wherever applicable.
* Our security solutions go beyond cryptographic protection and follow a defence-in-depth strategy to achieve resilience to faults, failures and attacks.
* Artificial intelligence serves as a foundational component of our cyber defence mechanism without draining scarce system resources.

# Our vision #

Is to safeguard networked space assets.

# The Team #

Founder __Dr. Yee Wei Law__ (“Law” for short, [UniSA profile](https://people.unisa.edu.au/YeeWei.Law), [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeeweilaw), [homepage](https://ywlaw.github.io)) specialises in cryptographic algorithms, protocols and architectures, as well as secure network protocol design. He is the main architect of the __Mesh in Space__ system.

Co-founder __Joshua Davis__ ([LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshua99911)) specialises in deep learning, as well as multi-domain physics-based modeling and simulations.

Co-founder __Andrew Du__ ([University of Adelaide profile](https://researchers.adelaide.edu.au/profile/andrew.du), [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewpatrickdu)) specialises in machine learning, especially deep learning and adversarial machine learning.
